# html-cleaner

## Usage

1. Copy formatted text from Google Docs and paste it into the box.
2. Click "Remove white-space preservation" (this option fixes the "Google Docs -> Email" formatting issue, but preserves all other formatting), or, click "Remove all non-schematic formatting" (this will remove all non-schematic formatting). 
3. Re-select and copy the text from the box and paste into your email client.  

## Notes
1. This software is provided "as is." Use it at your own risk.
2. There are other several generic tools online (you can search for "html cleaner"), and they usually have more features than mine. Mine is pretty limited to solving the "Google Docs -> email" formatting issue. 
3. All operations are done locally on the client side. No data is transmitted to the server or a third party. You can [check the source code](index.html) to be sure.
4. You can also use this tool to fix an ill-formatted email that you received. While that is not the intended usage, it should still fix most formatting issues. 
4. It works the best on Firefox, but should work fine on Chrome and Safari too. I am not certain if it works on IE/Edge at all. 
5. Feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/yymao/html-cleaner/issues) if you see any; though I cannot guarantee that I'll fix them.
